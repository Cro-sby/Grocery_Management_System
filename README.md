GroceryManagement – JavaFX Desktop Application

This project was developed for ECSE 223: Model-Based Programming at McGill University during Winter 2025, as part of a medium-scale software engineering project. The goal was to build a system that models a grocery store’s operations using Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) principles.

Tech Stack:

The application is built with Java, JavaFX for the user interface, and incorporates UML class diagrams, state machines, and UML sequence diagrams to model the system behavior. The project uses Gradle for build automation and Cucumber for acceptance testing.

Features:

-User Management: Register and log in as customers or employees.

-Order Management: Place, track, and cancel orders.

-Inventory Management: View and update inventory with shipments.

-Real-time UI: Interactive user interface with JavaFX.

System Architecture:
The system follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, ensuring a clean separation between data, logic, and user interface. Models and behaviors were defined using UML diagrams and were auto-generated into Java code for development.

I contributed significantly, taking on approximately 50% of the development workload, with a focus on order processing logic, inventory management, UI integration, and unit testing. I was responsible for coordinating much of the backend development while ensuring seamless communication with the front-end components.
